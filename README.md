This repo contains some of the questions I faced in Interviews. Collating the list here for future reference. Any alternate solutions are also welcome. 

_**Note**: As node is simple to implement, most of the files are .js files. It also has some other language files. They are added for collection sake, thats all. It needs to be added in their respective language environments for making them work._

## Project setup instructions

```sh
    cd /path/interview-solutions;
    npm i;
    node file_name.js
```
